## Mandatory assignment 1
_(to be presented on Monday, April 3)_

Design and develop a relational database for a library. Write appropriate SQL statements for declaring your relational database. Specify the keys and referential triggered actions. Choose the appropriate action (cascade, set to null, set to default, etc.) and justify your choice for each referential integrity constraint. Populate your database with realistic data, then specify and carry out a number of queries in SQL that are allowed by your database. Create a few triggers and stored procedures and test them with your database.
